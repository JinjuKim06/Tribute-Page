      <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug was an American agricultural scientist, agronomist, and humanitarian who was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Green Revolution, which increased crop yields and saved an estimated one billion people from starvation.</p>
      <p>Borlaug was born in Cresco, Iowa, in 1914. He earned a bachelor's degree in forestry from the University of Minnesota in 1937 and a master's degree in plant pathology from the University of Iowa in 1940. In 1942, he received his Ph.D. in plant pathology from the University of Minnesota.</p>
      <p>After completing his Ph.D., Borlaug worked as a plant pathologist for the Rockefeller Foundation in Mexico. He developed new wheat varieties that were resistant to disease and pests and that could produce high yields even in poor soils. These new wheat varieties helped to revolutionize Mexican agriculture and led to a dramatic increase in food production. Borlaug's work is credited with saving millions of lives from starvation.</p>
      <p>In 1970, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Green Revolution. He continued to work on agricultural development projects throughout the world until his death in 2009.</p>
